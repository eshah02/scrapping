We want to change that. We want to reimagine email. Building the modern email sending platform The web has come a long way in the last ten years, but why is email stuck in the past?It doesn't have to be that way. We want to change that. We want to reimagine email. Our story Our story Resend started with an open source project in 2022. We were frustrated by how difficult it was to build modern email templates that worked well across all email clients.As we started to dig deeper, it became clear that this was just the tip of the iceberg. We realized that sending emails that reach the inbox (not the spam folder) was the biggest pain point, so we started to explore something new.In 2023, we launched an entire email sending platform and joined Y Combinator's winter batch. We're creating something special here, and we're excited to build it with you. The team behind it A fully remote team on a mission to buildthe best communication platform for developers. Resend Team at Florence Offsite 2025 What we believe What we believe Principles that dictate how we think, behave, and make decisions. Zeno Rocha <zeno@resend.com> Do work that inspires others You can't inspire people by doing an “okay” job. To inspire, you need to do phenomenal work. Quality is not a plus; it's a must-have. We know nothing will ever be perfect, but that doesn't stop us from pushing the limits. We don't want to just meet the bar of our peers. We want to raise the bar. The sum of all the small details is what makes something special. Jonni Lundy <jonni@resend.com> No ego Helping others is part of the job. It's okay to admit you don't know something and ask for help - it's a sign of strength, not weakness. We work together as an async team and assume positive intent. We communicate in a kind, direct, and transparent way. Bu Kinoshita <bu@resend.com> Keep shipping Speed is key. We prioritize ruthlessly, have a strong sense of urgency, and make decisions fast. We constantly review the scope of a project and work toward a v0, not a v1. We ship early, and we ship often. Zeh Fernandes <zeh@resend.com> Default to action Regardless of what you do, we are all makers, and makers don't wait. When we see a problem, we don't expect someone to fix it or tell us what to do. Instead, we take initiative, find creative ways around it, and send a pull request to solve it. Remember - no problem is too small. Backed by incredible investors We are fortunate to work with some of the best investors in the world. Chances are you are already using the products they helped to create.

We didn't think we would get in, we didn't think we were special enough, but somehow they invited us for an interview. On November 30th, after pitching the idea to folks like Gustaf, Harj, and Diana, they finally accepted our application! We immediately quit our jobs and moved to San Francisco to start Resend. We joined the Winter 2023 batch, and had 3 months to get traction before Demo Day. It was crazy, we worked non-stop, made tons of mistakes, but most of all, made friends for life. YC was a special moment for us and we hope we can give back somehow. — Zeno Rocha, Founder & CEO The obligatory photo in front of the YC sign Companies using Resend Companies using Resend Start sending in minutes Resend delivers mission-critical emails for some of the fastest growing teams."

We were very unsatisfied with the current email products. They all felt outdated, with poor deliverability, and not really suitable for modern web development. So we decided to build something new. On March 13th, 2023 we met Alana for some coffee and pitched her the idea. By the end of the meeting, she pulled her phone and did something that no other investor had done before. She showed an app she was working on. In that app there were only two buttons: 'Yes' or 'Maybe'. After choosing one of the options, it sent an email to us using our own product. That's when we knew we had a true partner. Building a startup is not an easy task, but doing it with a community around you is far better. We hope we can give back with this. — Zeno Rocha, Founder & CEO The obligatory photo in front of the YC sign Companies using Resend Companies using Resend Start sending in minutes Resend delivers mission-critical emails for some of the fastest growing teams."

Get your .resend.app domain 2. Configure webhooks 3. Receive email events What can you do with Receiving emails FAQ Receiving Emails Copy page Learn how to receive emails via webhooks. Copy page Resend supports receiving emails (commonly called inbound) in addition to sending emails. This is useful for: Receiving support emails from users Processing forwarded attachments Replying to emails from customers ​How does it work How does it work Resend processes all incoming emails for your receiving domain, parses the contents and attachments, and then sends a POST request to an endpoint that you choose. POST To receive emails, you can either use a domain managed by Resend, or set up a custom domain. Importantly, any email sent to your receiving domain will be received by Resend and forwarded to your webhook. You can intelligently route based on the to field in the webhook event. to For example, if your domain is cool-hedgehog.resend.app, you will receive emails sent to [email protected]. cool-hedgehog.resend.app [email protected] The same applies to custom domains. If your domain is yourdomain.tld, you will receive emails sent to [email protected]. yourdomain.tld [email protected] Here’s how to start receiving emails using a domain managed by Resend. ​1. Get your .resend.app domain 1. Get your .resend.app domain .resend.app Any emails sent to an <anything>@<id>.resend.app address will be received by Resend and forwarded to your webhook. <anything>@<id>.resend.app To see your Resend domain: Go to the emails page. Select the “Receiving” tab. Click the three dots button and select “Receiving address.” ​2. Configure webhooks 2. Configure webhooks Go to the Webhooks page. Click Add Webhook. Add Webhook Enter the URL of your webhook endpoint. Select the event type email.received. email.received Click Add. Add For development, you can create a tunnel to your localhost server using a tool like ngrok or VS Code Port Forwarding. These tools serve your local dev environment at a public URL you can use to test your local webhook endpoint. Example: https://example123.ngrok.io/api/webhook https://example123.ngrok.io/api/webhook ​3. Receive email events 3. Receive email events In your application, create a new route that can accept POST requests. POST For example, here’s how you can add an API route in a Next.js application: import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'; import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'; export const POST = async (request: NextRequest) => { const event = await request.json(); if (event.type === 'email.received') { return NextResponse.json(event); } return NextResponse.json({}); }; import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'; import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server' ; import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'; import { NextResponse } from 'next/server' ; export const POST = async (request: NextRequest) => { export const POST = async ( request : NextRequest ) => { const event = await request.json(); const event = await request . json (); if (event.type === 'email.received') { if ( event . type === 'email.received' ) { return NextResponse.json(event); return NextResponse . json ( event ); } } return NextResponse.json({}); return NextResponse . json ({}); }; }; Once you receive the email event, you can process the email body and attachments. We also recommend implementing webhook request verification to secure your webhook endpoint. { \"type\": \"email.received\", \"created_at\": \"2024-02-22T23:41:12.126Z\", \"data\": { \"email_id\": \"56761188-7520-42d8-8898-ff6fc54ce618\", \"created_at\": \"2024-02-22T23:41:11.894719+00:00\", \"from\": \"Acme <[email protected]>\", \"to\": [\"[email protected]\"], \"bcc\": [], \"cc\": [], \"message_id\": \"<example+123>\", \"subject\": \"Sending this example\", \"attachments\": [ { \"id\": \"2a0c9ce0-3112-4728-976e-47ddcd16a318\", \"filename\": \"avatar.png\", \"content_type\": \"image/png\", \"content_disposition\": \"inline\", \"content_id\": \"img001\" } ] } } { { \"type\": \"email.received\", \"type\" : \"email.received\" , \"created_at\": \"2024-02-22T23:41:12.126Z\", \"created_at\" : \"2024-02-22T23:41:12.126Z\" , \"data\": { \"data\" : { \"email_id\": \"56761188-7520-42d8-8898-ff6fc54ce618\", \"email_id\" : \"56761188-7520-42d8-8898-ff6fc54ce618\" , \"created_at\": \"2024-02-22T23:41:11.894719+00:00\", \"created_at\" : \"2024-02-22T23:41:11.894719+00:00\" , \"from\": \"Acme <[email protected]>\", \"from\" : \"Acme <[email protected]>\" , \"to\": [\"[email protected]\"], \"to\" : [ \"[email protected]\" ], \"bcc\": [], \"bcc\" : [], \"cc\": [], \"cc\" : [], \"message_id\": \"<example+123>\", \"message_id\" : \"<example+123>\" , \"subject\": \"Sending this example\", \"subject\" : \"Sending this example\" , \"attachments\": [ \"attachments\" : [ { { \"id\": \"2a0c9ce0-3112-4728-976e-47ddcd16a318\", \"id\" : \"2a0c9ce0-3112-4728-976e-47ddcd16a318\" , \"filename\": \"avatar.png\", \"filename\" : \"avatar.png\" , \"content_type\": \"image/png\", \"content_type\" : \"image/png\" , \"content_disposition\": \"inline\", \"content_disposition\" : \"inline\" , \"content_id\": \"img001\" \"content_id\" : \"img001\" } } ] ] } } } } ​What can you do with Receiving emails What can you do with Receiving emails Once you receive an email, you can process it in a variety of ways. Here are some common actions you can take: Get email content Process attachments Forward emails to another address Reply to emails in the same thread Webhooks do not include the email body, headers, or attachments, only their metadata. You must call the the Received emails API or the Attachments API to retrieve them. This design choice supports large attachments in serverless environments that have limited request body sizes. ​FAQ FAQ Will I receive emails for any address at my domain? Yes. Once you add the MX record to your custom domains, you will receive emails for any address at that domain. For example, if your domain is yourdomain.tld, you will receive emails sent to <anything>@yourdomain.tld. You can then filter or route based on the to field in the webhook event. yourdomain.tld <anything>@yourdomain.tld to The same applies if you use the domain managed by Resend. If the domain given to you is cool-hedgehog.resend.app, you’ll receive any email send to <anything>@cool-hedgehog.resend.app. cool-hedgehog.resend.app <anything>@cool-hedgehog.resend.app Can I receive emails on a subdomain? Yes. You can add the MX record to any subdomain (e.g. subdomain.yourdomain.tld) and receive emails there. subdomain.yourdomain.tld Should I add the `MX` records for my root domain or a subdomain? If you already have existing MX records for your root domain, we recommend that you create a subdomain (e.g. subdomain.yourdomain.tld) and add the MX record there. This way, you can use Resend for receiving emails without affecting your existing email service. subdomain.yourdomain.tld If you still want to use the same domain both in for Resend and your day-to-day email service, you can also set up forwarding rules in your existing email service to forward emails to an address that’s configured in Resend or forward them directly to the SMTP server address that appears in the receiving MX record. MX Will I lose my emails if my webhook endpoint is down? No, you will not lose your emails. Resend stores emails as soon as they come in. Even if your webhook endpoint is down, you can still see your emails in the dashboard and retrieve them using the Receiving API. Additionally, we will retry delivering the webhook event on the schedule described in our webhooks documentation and you can also replay individual webhook events from the webhooks page in the dashboard. How can I make sure that it's Resend who's sending me webhooks? All of Resend’s webhooks include a secret and headers that you can use to verify the authenticity of the request. In our SDKs, you can verify webhooks using resend.webhooks.verify(), as shown below. resend.webhooks.verify() // throws an error if the webhook is invalid // otherwise, returns the parsed payload object const result = resend.webhooks.verify({ payload: JSON.stringify(req.body), headers: { id: req.headers['svix-id'], timestamp: req.headers['svix-timestamp'], signature: req.headers['svix-signature'], }, webhookSecret: process.env.RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET, }) // throws an error if the webhook is invalid // throws an error if the webhook is invalid // otherwise, returns the parsed payload object // otherwise, returns the parsed payload object const result = resend.webhooks.verify({ const result = resend . webhooks . verify ({ payload: JSON.stringify(req.body), payload: JSON . stringify ( req . body ), headers: { headers: { id: req.headers['svix-id'], id: req . headers [ 'svix-id' ], timestamp: req.headers['svix-timestamp'], timestamp: req . headers [ 'svix-timestamp' ], signature: req.headers['svix-signature'], signature: req . headers [ 'svix-signature' ], }, }, webhookSecret: process.env.RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET, webhookSecret: process . env . RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET , }) }) You can find more code samples and instructions on how to verify webhooks in our webhook verification documentation. Was this page helpful? Tags Custom Domains ⌘I"

What else could we ask for. Guillermo Rauch Creator of Next.js Built for React applications Integrate with react.email, our collection of high-quality, unstyled components for creating beautiful emails using TypeScript. Forget about inconsistencies with different email clients. import { Html , Button } from '@react-email/components' ; import * as React from 'react' ; interface EmailProps { link : string ; } export function Email ( { link } : EmailProps ) { return ( < Html lang = \" en \" dir = \" ltr \" > < Button href = { link } style = { { color : '#61dafb' } } > Click me </ Button > </ Html > ) ; } Send in under 10 minutes Watch how to integrate Resend with the Next.js App Router and Server Actions. import { EmailTemplate } from '@/components/email-template' ; import { Resend } from 'resend' ; const resend = new Resend ( process . env . RESEND_API_KEY ) ; export async function POST ( ) { const { data , error } = await resend . emails . send ( { from : 'onboarding@resend.dev' , to : 'delivered@resend.dev' , subject : 'Hello world' , react : EmailTemplate ( { firstName : 'John' } ) , } ) ; if ( error ) { return Response . json ( { error } ) ; } return Response . json ( data ) ; } Integrate with the Next.js App Router The App Router is a new paradigm for building applications using React Server Components. Resend is compatible with the App Router and the latest versions of Next.js. Send Form Emails with Server Actions Integrate Resend with Server Actions by defining an asynchronous function with the \"use server\" directive at the top of the function body. This will ensure that Resend is only executed on the server. import { Resend } from 'resend' ; export default async function Page ( ) { async function send ( ) { 'use server' ; const resend = new Resend ( process . env . RESEND_API_KEY ) ; const { data } = await resend . emails . send ( { from : 'Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>' , to : [ 'delivered@resend.dev' ] , subject : 'Hello World' , html : '<strong>It works!</strong>' } ) ; console . log ( data ) ; } return ( < form action = { send } > < button type = \"submit\" > Send email < / button > < / form > ) } import type { NextApiRequest , NextApiResponse } from 'next' ; import { EmailTemplate } from '@/components/email-template' ; import { Resend } from 'resend' ; const resend = new Resend ( 're_xxxxxxxxx' ) ; export default async ( req : NextApiRequest , res : NextApiResponse ) => { const { data , error } = await resend . emails . send ( { from : 'onboarding@resend.dev' , to : 'delivered@resend.dev' , subject : 'Hello World' , react : EmailTemplate ( { firstName : 'John' } ) , } ) ; if ( error ) { return res . status ( 400 ) . json ( error ) ; } return res . status ( 200 ) . json ( data ) ; } Works with the Pages Router Before Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way to create routes. The Pages Router is still supported in newer versions of Next.js and can be used with Resend. \"I've added emails to my site in 30 minutes.

We didn't think we would get in, we didn't think we were special enough, but somehow they invited us for an interview. On November 30th, after pitching the idea to folks like Gustaf, Harj, and Diana, they finally accepted our application! We immediately quit our jobs and moved to San Francisco to start Resend. We joined the Winter 2023 batch, and had 3 months to get traction before Demo Day. It was crazy, we worked non-stop, made tons of mistakes, but most of all, made friends for life. YC was a special moment for us and we hope we can give back somehow. — Zeno Rocha, Founder & CEO The obligatory photo in front of the YC sign Companies using Resend Companies using Resend Start sending in minutes Resend delivers mission-critical emails for some of the fastest growing teams."
