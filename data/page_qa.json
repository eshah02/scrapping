    "qa": "This page describes Resend's \"inbound\" email receiving feature, allowing users to receive emails via webhooks in addition to sending them.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nResend offers an \"inbound\" email receiving feature, complementing its sending capabilities. It's designed for use cases like handling customer support emails, processing forwarded attachments, and enabling replies from customers. The system works by Resend processing all incoming emails sent to a designated receiving domain (either a Resend-managed `.resend.app` domain or a custom domain). It parses the email contents and attachments, then forwards this information as a POST request to a user-configured webhook endpoint. The setup involves three main steps: obtaining a Resend receiving address (or configuring a custom domain), configuring a webhook URL on the Resend platform with the `email.received` event type, and creating an application route to handle the incoming email events. Users can then process the email body and attachments, intelligently routing based on the `to` field in the webhook event. Resend also recommends implementing webhook request verification for security.\n\n---\n\n**Q&A:**\n\n1.  **What is the primary function of Resend's \"Receiving Emails\" feature?**\n    *   The primary function is to allow users to receive incoming emails (commonly called inbound) via webhooks, complementing Resend's email sending capabilities.\n\n2.  **What are some practical use cases mentioned for receiving emails with Resend?**\n    *   Practical use cases include receiving support emails from users, processing forwarded attachments, and replying to emails from customers.\n\n3.  **How does Resend process and deliver incoming emails to a user's application?**\n    *   Resend processes all incoming emails for the receiving domain, parses their contents and attachments, and then sends a POST request to a user-chosen webhook endpoint.\n\n4.  **What two types of domains can be used for receiving emails through Resend?**\n    *   Users can either use a domain managed by Resend (e.g., `<anything>@<id>.resend.app`) or set up a custom domain (e.g., `<anything>@yourdomain.tld`).\n\n5.  **What specific event type should a webhook be configured to listen for when receiving emails, and what is a recommended security measure?**\n    *   The webhook should be configured to listen for the `email.received` event type. It's also recommended to implement webhook request verification to secure the webhook endpoint."

Key tenets include designing for global inclusivity, accommodating diverse skill levels, tech stacks, and economic backgrounds, exemplified by a generous free tier and multi-language SDKs. They emphasize a zero-friction onboarding process, enabling developers to go from \"hello world\" to production in minutes without credit card requirements, numerous steps, or lengthy verifications. Documentation is treated as a core product, not an afterthought, requiring dedicated development, CI/CD, and a roadmap. Uptime and reliability are paramount, likened to water's essential role, forming the foundation of trust. The platform strives for predictability, ensuring consistent contracts, interfaces, and backwards compatibility to prevent surprises. Speed is a constant obsession across all interactions, with a commitment to prioritizing user speed even if it increases internal complexity. Finally, Resend aims to be an \"order of magnitude better\" by meticulously obsessing over every small detail, believing that the sum of these details creates a superior product.\n\n---\n\n**5 Q&A:**\n\n1.  **Q:** What does Resend mean by \"Make it for everyone\" in their developer experience principles?\n    **A:** \"Make it for everyone\" means designing beyond specific demographics like San Francisco engineers, considering users' varied skill levels, diverse technology stacks, and economic situations (including users at the margins who may have slower computers or networks). This is supported by a generous free tier, SDKs for all languages, and beginner-friendly documentation.\n\n2.  **Q:** How does Resend aim to achieve \"zero friction\" in a developer's first impression?\n    **A:** Resend aims for zero friction by ensuring a flawless onboarding experience. This means not asking for a credit card, avoiding dozens of steps, not requiring a \"demo\" or \"call,\" and eliminating two-day verification processes, allowing developers to go from \"hello world\" to production in minutes.\n\n3.  **Q:** What is Resend's unique perspective on documentation, and how does it differ from most companies?\n    **A:** Resend views \"documentation as the product,\" rather than an afterthought. They treat it as a first-class citizen, requiring CI/CD, in-app integration, constant updates, and its own roadmap, recognizing it as one of the first and most frequent interactions developers have with the product.\n\n4.  **Q:** Why does Resend compare \"uptime\" to \"water\" in their philosophy?\n    **A:** Resend compares uptime to water because it is considered as essential for infrastructure as water is for life. Reliability is the foundation of everything they do, and any downtime leads to a loss of trust, just as one wouldn't drink water that is only treated 99% of the time.\n\n5.  **Q:** What is Resend's ultimate goal for their product's impact, and how do they plan to achieve it in terms of detail and speed?\n    **A:** Resend's ultimate goal is for their product to be an \"order of magnitude better\" than existing solutions. They plan to achieve this by constantly decreasing response times and improving performance, always prioritizing what's faster for the user even if it makes internal building or maintenance harder, and by obsessing over every detail, no matter how small."
